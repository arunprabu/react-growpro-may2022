        1. Server has to do the heavy-lifting 
        2. Slower Webapps 
        3. More Bandwidth Consumption 
        4. More Expensive 
        5. Not a better user experience 


  2. Client Side Rendering Apps (CSR) / Modern Webapps 
      * Pages will not reload / refresh

        2 Servers 
          1 Front End Server (port 3000) - Single Page App (SPA)
              Resp: HTML, CSS, JS, placeholder for data (wait for data)

          1 Back End Server (port 8080 ) - RESTful API

        1. Workload is shared between two servers 
        2. Faster Webapps 
        3. Less Bandwidth Consumption 
        4. Less Expensive 
        5. Better User Experience to end users

        1. Not Search Engine Friendly (can be fixed)
        2. Initial Loading will take longer (can be fixed)

==
JSX 
--
  * all elements should be closed (either self closing / separte closing)
  * class should become className 
  * inline styles will be different too

Cross Component Communication / Sharing data across component 
--
  1. Parent Comp to Child Component Communication [DONE]
     using props 

  2. Child Comp to Parent Component Communication [TODO]
      using props, events, callback fn 

  3. Any to Any Component Communication
      using Context API of ReactJS or 
      using Redux Framework

  * objects - can have Data suffix (contactData) or else (contact)
  * booleans -- isLoggedIn, isValid, hasToken, isAuth
