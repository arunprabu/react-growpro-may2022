  * all elements should be closed (either self closing / separte closing)
  * class should become className 
  * inline styles will be different too

  1. Parent Comp to Child Component Communication [DONE]
     using props 

  2. Child Comp to Parent Component Communication [TODO]
      using props, events, callback fn

naming conventions
-
  * comp names PascalCase
  * variables, methods, event handlers -- in camelCase 
  * arrays -- in camelCase but in plural (colors, channels) or else (colorList, channelList)
  * objects - can have Data suffix (contactData) or else (contact)
  * booleans -- isLoggedIn, isValid, hasToken, isAuth 
  * event handler methods or functions in react -- should have handle Prefix or else Handler suffix 
      (handleAddToFavorite, addToFavouriteHandler)
  * never use snake case

Routing in React 
---
  Step 1: 
    npm i react-router-dom

  Step 2: 
    Identify the URL's for each menu item
    Home          =>   localhost:3000/
    HOC Demo      =>   localhost:3000/hoc-demo
    Unit Testing  =>   localhost:3000/unit-testing
    Hooks Demo    =>   localhost:3000/hooks
    Products      =>   localhost:3000/context

  Step 3: 
    Let's setup the URL's properly in Menu comp.
    Check the app. URL's will change. Page will still refresh.

  Step 4: 
    Create the necessary comp for all the URL's 

    Home comp is already created. Let's create other components 

  Step 5: 
    in App Comp, Let's configure the routes 
    Put the whole app under <BrowserRouter>
    Then, in between header and footer, config the routes 
    <Routes>
      <Route path='/' element={<Home />} />
      <Route path='/hoc-demo' element={<HocDemo />} />
      <Route path='/unit-testing' element={<UnitTestingDemo />} />
      <Route path='/hooks' element={<HooksDemo />} />
      <Route path='/context' element={<ContextDemo />} />
    </Routes>
    
  Step 6: 
    Check the app. Page will still refresh. Fix it.
    Replace a href with NavLink to 
    <NavLink to="/" className="nav-link active" aria-current="page" >Home</NavLink>


  TODO: Setup active menu 
  TODO: Setup Page Title. Use react-helmet package


----

Working with useContext() Hook 
---
  Let's share data across comp 

  Step 1: 
    create context with any data or null 
    createContext() 
  
  Step 2: 
    Provide the data to the the whole app  
  
  Step 3: 
    Using Provider to share data across the few components 
    <Context.Provider>
      <Home />
      <About/>
    </Context.Provider>

  Step4: 
    consume the in the components 
    useContext()

ReactJS - Performance Tips
--
1. Use NPM package or any third party libraries only if absolutely needed.
2. Most performance issues come in lists. So, think about having pagination.
  Try this awesome package
  https://bvaughn.github.io/react-virtualized/
3. Make use of props wisely. Don't leave out unused props. 
   
  if our app doesn't display the userId anywhere.. dont receive such a prop data)
  So, a bad way could be...
  const MyComp = (props) => { //bad way if all props are not used

  }

  but a better way to have props is here.. using object destructuring.
  cont MyComp = ({ title, body, postId}){ // ignoring userId, if I don't display it anywhere

  }
  Also,don't pass unneccessary props. 
  And wise idea is not to store userId in the redux store.

4. Lazy Load Images 
  https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-lazy-load-image-component
5. Use profiler to record the app pages. And then check and fix the app. 
6. Use Redux Dev Tools to check how long it take for the actions.
7. Think about optimizing back end also. 
8. Avoid having unnecessary tags, css. go with Fragment, <></>, 
9. Don't bloat the page with too many components, 
  because will have lifecycle hooks and will have re-rendering cycles.
  If one parent comp updates, that will update child comp's till the last level.
  Solution could be to use Pure Components 
10. Don't have more class components. Use functional components. 
  Use hooks to stop child comp re-rendering. Remember useEffect, useCallback!
11. Don't write too many inline styles. You should definitely avoid it inside loops.
12. Don't write inline callbacks in loops. 
    // bad 
    <button onClick={() => deleteRecord()} >Delete</button> 
    // good 
    const deleteRecord = () =>{

    }
    <button onClick={deleteRecord} >Delete</button> 

13. Use Why did you update tool
    https://www.npmjs.com/package/@welldone-software/why-did-you-render
14. shouldComponentUpdate lifecycle hook
15. Learn more performance tips.. There are aplenty.
